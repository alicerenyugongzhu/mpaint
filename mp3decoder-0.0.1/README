=== Prereq. ===

Using this code requires:

*) A Haskell compiler, such as GHC.

*) binary-strict, from here: 
   http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/binary-strict
   If you've never used Haskell before, install binary-strict by 
   downloading and unpacking the source, cd to the directory where the
   Setup file is, and do

     $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
     $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
     $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install

That's it.



=== Building the decoder ===

Building the decoder works almost the same as building binary-strict. 
From the directory where this file is, do:

$ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
$ runhaskell Setup.lhs build

Do not install it (if you're familiar with Haskell and for some reason
want to install this decoder as a library, you'll have to edit the 
cabal file).

When done, there will be an executable file in dist/build/mp3driver.
Pass an MP3 file to it

$ mp3driver test.mp3

And it will write a file, "out.wav", to the current directory.

The actual decoder is in Codec/Audio/MP3. Change parts of it, run
the build command again, and see what happens. :-)



=== Trouble? ===

If, for some reason, the above doesn't work, there's a manual method
of building the mp3driver program. Copy all *.hs, *.h and *.c files
to the same directory. Build the two C files:

$ gcc -O2 -c c_imdct.c
$ gcc -O2 -c c_synth.c

Change all "import Codec.Audio.MP3.XXX" in the Haskell source files
to "import XXX". Then:

$ ghc c_imdct.o c_synth.o --make Driver.hs
